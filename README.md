# Omnifood Website

This is a simple HTML and CSS project for the Omnifood website.  It demonstrates a responsive design for a food delivery service.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3

## How to Run

1.  **Download or clone the repository:** If you have the files in a repository (like on GitHub), you'll need to download or clone it to your local machine.

2.  **Open `index.html` in your browser:**  Navigate to the `omnifood` folder on your computer.  Double-click the `index.html` file. This should open the website in your default web browser.  Alternatively, you can right-click `index.html` and choose "Open with" and then select your browser.

That's it!  Because it's just HTML and CSS, no server or other setup is required.  Your browser will render the HTML and apply the styles from the CSS files.
